# airport-transfer-widget

I want to build a airport transfer widget for my taxi website where a user can enter dates and information to book a taxi for an airport transfer, It should have an  admin page where i can add the prices of the different airports, and anything else you think to make it work perfectly, it should then email the information to hello@blackpoolcabs.com please ensure it looks nice with little icons. I want a proper professional looking taxi booking widget.
